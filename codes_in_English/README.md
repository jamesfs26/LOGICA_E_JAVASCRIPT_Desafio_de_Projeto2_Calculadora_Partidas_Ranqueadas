# **2nd Project Challenge 📃 - Ranked Matches Calculator 🔢: 🥉🥈🥇**

### **Technologies to use:**

* Variables
* Operators
* Loops
* Conditional Statements
* Functions

### **Objective:**
Create a function that takes a player's number of wins and losses as parameters, then returns the result to a variable. The ranked balance should be calculated by (wins - losses).

### **Ranking System:**

* Less than 10 wins = Iron
* 11-20 wins = Bronze 🥉
* 21-50 wins = Silver 🥈
* 51-80 wins = Gold 🥇
* 81-100 wins = Legendary 🏅
* 101+ wins = Immortal 🏆

## **My Algorithm:**

For this project challenge, I created 2 code files implementing the solution in different ways. Both files use fundamental programming concepts: variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## **1st File - Using Conditional Statements:**

Created a function (calculateHeroLevel) with 3 parameters (heroName, victoriesObtained, heroRank). Implemented an 'if' conditional structure using comparison operators (<, >, =) and logical operator && (AND). Used string interpolation with console.log(Message ${}) to display the final result.

## **2nd File - Using Decision Structure:**

Maintained the base structure (function: calculateHeroLevel, parameters: heroName, victoriesObtained) and added a let variable for the third parameter (heroRank). Implemented a loop structure with a 'for' loop and iterator variable 'i'. Used switch/case control structure for simplified multi-choice decision making.
